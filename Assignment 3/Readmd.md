## Assignment 3 - Working with SVM

Python program (svm.py) that will read the file optdigits.tra (3,823 samples) that includes training instances of handwritten digits (optically recognized). Read the file optdigits.names to get detailed information about this dataset. Also, check the file optdigits-orig.tra and optdigits-orig.names to see the original format of this data, and how it was transformed to speed-up thelearning process (pre-processing phase). Your goal is to build multiple SVM classifiers using this data. You will simulate a grid search, trying to find which combination of four SVM hyperparameters (c, degree, kernel, and decision_function_shape) leads you to the best prediction performance. To test the accuracy of those distinct models, you will use the file optdigits.tes (1,797 samples).
